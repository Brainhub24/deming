The schedule screen provides a view of the controls carried out and to be carried out.

The left part of the screen contains past and future checks. By clicking on a column,
you are returned to the [list of controls](controls.md/#list) planned for the corresponding month.


The right side contains the checks scheduled for this month. It is possible to change the current month and select
a [control](controls.md/#show) in the calendar.
